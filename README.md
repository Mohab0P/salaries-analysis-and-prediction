# Salary Analysis and Prediction

A comprehensive project for analyzing salary data and building predictive models using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project loads and cleans a salary dataset, performs extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) including statistical analysis and various data visualizations (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate), and builds predictive models to estimate salaries based on multiple features.

## Project Structure

- **modl.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data exploration and model building workflow.
- **salaries.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Import and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Summary statistics and distribution analysis.
  - Visualizations including histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and 3D plots.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**:
  - Creation of pipelines for preprocessing.
  - Building regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest).
  - Model training, testing, and validation with relevant metrics.
